//class = 			non abstract method
//Abstract class = 	non abstract method  + abstract method
//interface=							   abstract method (Java 8 : Default method & static method)

//class = 			can not handle 
//Abstract class = 	can not handle
//interface=		but it can handle multiple inheritance

//class = 			not possible abstraction
//Abstract class = 	possible (0 to 100%)
//interface=		possible always 100%

//Abstract class Vs interface
